### **Key Touches**:
- **Magical Theme**: All tech terms are playfully renamed (e.g., "Spellbook" = progress tracker).  
- **Clear Structure**: Separates whimsy from technical details.  
- **Visual Potential**: Add a **wand-waving GIF** or **animated wizard mascot** later!  

Would you like me to suggest a **color palette** (e.g., purples/blues for magic) or **logo concepts**? 🎨
